            <b>Just because my posts regard NSFW topics & content <u>DOES NOT MEAN</u>
            that I am open to sexting or flirting during chats.</b> I am in a
            dedicated monogamous relationship and am not interested in
            entertaining attempts to flirt with the intent to start a romantic /
            sexual relationship with me. Anyone attempting this will be blocked
            out of respect for my partner. I also do not ERP, do not contact me
            with the intent of asking me to ERP.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>I will gladly discuss NSFW / kink topics, but <u>SOLELY</u> in a platonic,
            educational, or supportive context.</b> I'm happy to offer my (probably
            limited amount of) assistance, share experience, and give / take
            compliments when necessary, but any sort of (non silly) flirting, sexual
            advances, or boundary pushing won't be tolerated.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>I will <u>ABSOLUTELY NOT</u> interact with anyone under the age of 18.</b>
            Whether on social media, instant messaging, or any other relevant
            platform. If I am contacted by someone under the age of 18 on my
            NSFW account, with absolutely no exceptions, I will block them
            immediately. Do not attempt to interact with my content if you are
            &lt;18 years old.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>There are topics that I <u>WILL NOT</u> discuss. Please accept that.</b> There
            are NSFW topics or kinks that make me uncomfortable and that I'm not
            into discussing, I expect that to be respected. Some examples are:
            Ageplay, Beastiality, Scat, Vore, Incest, Raceplay, etc. These are
            things that I'm either against or just simply not into, refrain from bringing them up.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>My DMs are open but <u>ONLY</u> for respectful conversation.</b> When
            interacting with me, be respectful. Do not be racist, homophobic,
            transphobic, etc when interacting with me. I won't tolerate verbal
            abuse in my DMs and you'll just be blocked.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>I treat everyone's private messages with care, so should you.</b> Unless
            I've given permission, I expect for DMs to stay private between me
            and whoever I'm conversing with. Please do not leak or publicize
            private messages without my consent. I will NEVER leak messages and
            if necessary will always ask for consent before sharing your private
            messages to me with others.
